Description: the package takes one or more genetic relatedness matrices (i.e., kinship, IBS, etc.) and a design matrix of fixed effect to form a linear mixed model, and solve it with GCTA. It does so by writing the R matrix objects to temporary files recoganizable by GCTA, and call the executable (automatically download) from within R, collect the report, and clean up. GCTA is developed by Jian Yang et. al., which is a popular tool for calculating the genetic contribution to a phenotype of interest.
